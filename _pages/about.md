## üíª Experience

**ASR workflow and AI Customer Service Agent**
*(Jul. 2025 ‚Äì Present)*
- Finetuning advanced ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and SPK (Speaker Recognition) models for specialized language applications.
- Engineered a complete ASR workflow featuring a SeacoParaformer model finetuned on a Chinese dialect dataset.
- Developed an intelligent customer service agent by building a business-specific RAG knowledge base using LangChain.

**LLM-as-Judge Benchmark**
*(Dec. 2024 ‚Äì May. 2025)*
- Developed an LLM-as-judge benchmark to quantify the quality of creative text, aiding in dataset cleaning and model fine-tuning.
- Scored 40,000 web novel samples across eight distinct perspectives using DeepSeek-V3. The dataset is available at [webnovelbench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Oedon42/webnovelbench).
- Distilled the scoring capabilities of DeepSeek-V3 into a lightweight model by fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-7B. The corresponding paper can be found on [arXiv (2505.14818)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.14818).

**Autonomous Data Collecting and Captioning Agent Design**
*(Oct. 2024 ‚Äì Nov. 2024)*
- Designed and built LLM-powered agents to automate the collection, cleaning, and captioning of image data for constructing open-source datasets.
- Curated a specialized dataset of 283 Thang-ka images.
- Trained a LoRA model for Stable Diffusion-XL on the curated dataset, enabling the generation of culturally specific images. The model is available at [thangka-lora-xl](https://huggingface.co/Oedon42/thangka-lora-xl).

**Throughput Maximization with Vision Latent Cache**
*Research Intern | Tutor: Dr. Shimin Gong*
*(2023 ‚Äì Present)*
- Investigating methods to enhance Neural Network throughput by encoding and decoding images superimposed in latent space.
- Built an adjusted Cold Diffusion model for sophisticated image overlapping and decoding tasks.
- Developed a full system prototype using GNURadio and PyTorch for efficient data transmission. The project is detailed on [arXiv (2504.07498)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.07498) and the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/OedonLestrange42/GNURadio-WiFI-ImageTransfer).
