## Experience

### **Superposition of Discontinuous Images & Interpretable DNN.** SYSU. Shenzhen, China -- 2023 -- Present
**Role:** Research Intern (Tutor: Dr. Shimin Gong)
*Brief introduction: Compressive imaging on discontinuous images with physical neural network.*
- Designed an image encoding method capable of superposing multiple images without increasing data volume, enabling light-weighted data storage and transmission. Paper preview available at [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.07498](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.07498).
- Built a physical neural network utilizing an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for the light-weighted image transmission system.
- Proposed a truncated DRL approach for compressing tokenized image representations, which significantly improves convergence and enhances interpretability.

### **Web Novel Benchmark Project** -- Dec. 2024 -- May. 2025
**Role:** Main Contributor (Individual Projects)
*Brief introduction: Developed an LLM-as-judge benchmark for quantifying web novel quality, assisting in fine-tuning and dataset cleaning.*
- Scored 40,000 web novel samples across 8 dimensions using DeepSeek-V3. Raw data is available at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Oedon42/webnovelbench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Oedon42/webnovelbench).
- Fine-tuned a Qwen-2.5-7B model to distill DeepSeek-V3's scoring capabilities into a lightweight model.
- Tested over 20 prevalent LLMs using the developed benchmark. The web novel benchmark paper can be found at [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.14818](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.14818).

### **LLM Agent Design** -- Oct. 2024 -- Nov. 2024
**Role:** Main Contributor (Individual Projects)
*Brief introduction: Created LLM agents for collecting, cleaning, and captioning image data to construct open-source datasets.*
- Built a dataset containing 283 Thang-ka images.
- Trained a LoRA model for Stable Diffusion-xl based on the collected images, available at [https://huggingface.co/Oedon42/thangka-lora-xl](https://huggingface.co/Oedon42/thangka-lora-xl).
- Demonstrated that the fine-tuned SD-xl model can effectively follow specific instructions, such as generating 'Avalokiteshvara'.
